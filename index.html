 <h1>My Favorite Musician</h1>
 <h2>Making the Decision</h2>
 <p>The SPOTIFY APP on my laptop is populated with everything from Classic Rock to Country, Rap to R & B, and Motown to Gospel. The decades of the 50's-90's are represented, as well as current hits from contemporary artists, and a myriad of other musical categories. So, when I was asked to choose my favorite musician, I found the task very daunting. You see, I LOVE music....almost every genre. Music is so important to me for a number of reasons. Sometimes the song currently playing conveys a message or a feeling that I can't describe in words. Sometimes, it's the nostalgia that takes me back to a certain place in time, or reminds me of a specific event. Better yet, it could be the haunting melody in the background paired with equally haunting lyrics. However, after careful contemplation, I made the decision to go with a band that represents all these things, and is to the soul, what comfort food is to the body.

<h2>The Deciding Factor</h2>
<p>I wanted my choice to reflect everything that I previously mentioned, but I also thought about what this band had meant to me over the years. I contemplated different stages of where I was at in my life, how oftened I listened to them at those points, the frequency with which I attended their concerts, and the memories I made when went to see them. After careful consideration, I made my selection.</p>

<h3>And the Winner Is......</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I had to go with the Dave Matthews Band. I can remember in the 90's, being at both SPAC and the Times Union Center to see them on many occassions. The memories of those times range from excitement, to nostalgia, to melancholy, depending on the circumstances or events in my life. No matter what I was experiencing at any given time, there's something about his soft, sweet, melodic voice, accompanied by his ensemble of incredibly talented bandmates, that puts my soul at ease. The following are the top 10 Dave Matthews songs that are my favorites:</p>

<li>Grace Is Gone</li>
<li>Grey Street</li>
<li>Crash Into Me</li>
<li>Crush</li>
<li>Satellite</li>
