 <h1>Making the Decision</h1>
 <p>When asked to choose my favorite musician, I found the task very daunting. You see, I LOVE music....almost every genre. Music is so important to me for a number of reasons. Sometimes the song currently playing conveys a message or a feeling that I can't describe in words. Sometimes, it's the nostalgia that takes me back to a certain place in time, or reminds me of a specific event. Better yet, it could be the haunting melody in the background that matches the equally haunting lyrics. The SPOTIFY APP on my laptop is populated with everything from Classic Rock to Country, Rap to R & B, Mowtown to Gospel. The decades of the 50's-90's are well represented, as well as current artists and hits. However, I didn't stop there. I also created lists of Women Who Rock, Musicals/Movies, Classical Music, Hard Rock, and Traditional Christmas songs.
